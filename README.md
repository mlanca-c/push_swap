# Intro

 > [subject](subject.pdf)

 This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.
 To succeed you'll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

 The **push_swap** project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted.
